# RESTful Postcrossing #

## What is this script? ##

This Greasemonkey userscript simplifies the process of registering a postcard received through the [Postcrossing service](http://www.postcrossing.com/). Normally you have to go to the postcard registering page, find the country code in the drop-down list, enter the number and then proceed to filling in the comment for the sender. With this userscript, the process is simplified: You can enter the postcard code directly as a part of the URL. For example, you type http://www.postcrossing.com/CC-123456 to register a postcard with ID CC-123456. Normally, Postcrossing just shows you a 404 page, but with the userscript installed, you are redirected to the registering page with the country code and number filled in. You just have to write your message for the sender of the card. It’s similar to the way, how the coords.info service works for directly accesing entities at [Geocaching.com website](http://www.geocaching.com). Of course you have to be signed in with your Postcrossing account for this userscript to work.

## What is Postcrossing? ##

[Postcrossing](http://www.postcrossing.com/) is a web project for people who like to exchange postcards by real (physical) mail. After signing up, you can request an address of a random person in the world, whom you then have to send a postcard to. For every postcard sent, you receive one in return. The service tries its best for you to have contact with most countries of the world. It’s also a good way, how to find penpals.
